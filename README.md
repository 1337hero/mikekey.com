This site is my little corner of the internet — a place where I’ve been writing, tinkering, and experimenting since 2006. It’s gone through a few lives already:

- 📝 WordPress (the early blogging days, when I was just figuring things out)
- 🔧 Jekyll (my first real taste of static site generators and developer control)
- 🚀 Astro (the current chapter, where I’m bringing old content back to life and mixing it with new ideas)

For a long time, the site sat dormant. But this year I decided to revive it — not just as an archive of old musings, but as a living project I can continue to build on.


## Status

This site will probably always be “**in progress.**” And I like it that way.

If you stumble across it, I hope you find something useful, entertaining, or at least a reminder that building on the web should be a little bit fun.


## License

This site’s mine. A lot of the code here is stitched together from smarter folks who were generous enough to share what they built or wrote about. I return the favor where I can. Steal what’s useful, bend it to your own projects, but don’t just copy-paste the whole thing — **it’s not a template**.
